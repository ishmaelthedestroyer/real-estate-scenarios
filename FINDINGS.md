### Findings

- taking out a mortgage in bulk only makes sense at 7.5% interest rate and lower with the real delta at 7.2% and lower
- taking out a mortage only makes sense when operating costs are 45% and lower
- targeting properties that rent at 1.5% of the purchase price per month doubles the profit from 1%. targeting 2% more than quadruples profit from 1%. the bottom threshold that makes sense is 1.4%

### Ideal Strategy

- keep operating expenses under 45% of rent
- target rent prices that are 1.25% of the purchase price or higher
- get mortgages for 7.5% or lower
- put down 20% on each property
- target properties between $200k - $250k

### Assumptions

- Can I find properties for $200k that can generate $2.8k / mo?
- Can I find properties for $250k that can generate $3.5k / mo?
- Can I get an interest rate for 7.5% or below?
